# ValkeyLDAP - Valkey LDAP authentication module  ![CI](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-ldap/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg) [![Copr Build Status](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/rjd15372/valkey-ldap/package/valkey-ldap-nightly/status_image/last_build.png)](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/rjd15372/valkey-ldap/package/valkey-ldap-nightly/)

The `valkey-ldap` module is a Rust based Valkey module that adds the support for handling user authentication against LDAP based identity providers.

The module works by registering and authentication handler that intercepts the valkey `AUTH` command, which validates the the username and password, specified in the `AUTH` command, using an LDAP server. Therefore the user must already exist in Valkey before LDAP can be used for authentication.

## LDAP Authentication Modes

This module supports two LDAP authentication modes. The `bind` mode, and the `search+bind` mode.

The `bind` mode can be used when the username mostly matches the DN of user entries in the LDAP directory, while the `search+bind` mode allows for a much more flexible LDAP directory structure.

### Bind Mode Authentication

In the `bind` mode, the module will bind to the distinguished name constructed by prepending a configurable prefix and appending a configurable suffix to the username.
Typically, the prefix parameter is used to specify `cn=`, or `DOMAIN\` in an Active Directory environment. The suffix is used to specify the remaining part of the DN in a non-Active Directory environment.

### Search+Bind Authentication

In the `search+bind` mode, the module first binds to the LDAP directory with a username and password of an account that has permissions to perform search operation in the LDAP directory.
If no username and password is configured for the binding phase, an anonymous bind will be attempted to the directory.

After the binding phase, a search operation is performed over the subtree at a configurable base DN string, and will try to do an exact match of the username specified in the `AUTH` command against the value of a configurable entry attribute.

Once the user has been found in this search, the module re-binds to the LDAP directory as this user, using the password specified in the `AUTH` command, to verify that the login is correct.

This mode allows for significantly more flexibility in where the user objects are located in the directory, but will cause two additional requests to the LDAP server to be made.

## LDAP-Based Authorization

In addition to authentication, the module supports authorization backed by LDAP.

Two approaches are available:

- Legacy mapping to ACL users: Map LDAP groups to Valkey ACL user names via `ldap.group_acl_user_map` (comma-separated `group=acluser`). After successful bind, the client is authenticated as the mapped ACL user.
- Dynamic ACL rule sync (recommended): Read ACL rule tokens directly from LDAP group entries and apply them with `ACL SETUSER` at login. The client is authenticated as the Valkey user with the same name as the LDAP username; rules are provisioned automatically.

### Dynamic ACL Rule Sync

After a successful LDAP bind, the module searches group entries matching the user DN and reads rule tokens from a configurable attribute on each group. All tokens are merged (duplicates deduplicated) and combined with module defaults. The resulting set is applied via `ACL SETUSER <username> <rules...>` before the client is authenticated.

- `ldap.groups_rules_attribute`: LDAP attribute on group entries containing space-delimited ACL rule tokens. Default: `valkeyACL`.
- `ldap.default_acl_rules`: Module-level default tokens always applied. Default: `on resetpass`.
- Group search controls: `ldap.groups_search_base` (fallback to `ldap.search_base`), `ldap.groups_filter` (default `objectClass=groupOfNames`), `ldap.groups_member_attribute` (default `member`).

Example group entry attributes:

```
dn: cn=appdev-team,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: groupOfNames
cn: appdev-team
member: cn=bob,ou=users,dc=example,dc=com
valkeyACL: +@read ~proj:app:* -@dangerous
```

Resulting user rules (assuming defaults `on resetpass`):

```
ACL SETUSER bob on resetpass +@read ~proj:app:* -@dangerous
```

Notes:

- Tokens from all matched groups are merged; duplicates are removed.
- If the LDAP attribute is missing or empty, only `ldap.default_acl_rules` are applied.
- You do not need to pre-create complex ACL users or update server-side ACLs manually; rules are provisioned at login.

## Setting Up Valkey Users

As mentioned before, this module requires that user accounts must exist in Valkey in order to authenticate LDAP users. This restriction is necessary because the ACL rules for each LDAP user are stored in the Valkey user account.

For a user `bob` to be successfully authenticated by the LDAP module it must exist in the Valkey ALC database with the same username `bob`.

We can create the Valkey user `bob` without a password, to prevent someone from trying to log in using `bob` account using the password-based authentication method.

To create a user without a password we need to set the `resetpass` rule in the ACL rules list. Example:

```
ACL SET USER bob on resetpass +@hash
```

After creating the above user `bob` in Valkey, it will only be possible to authenticate user `bob` with a successful authentication from the LDAP module.

### Automatic Cleanup of Deleted LDAP Users

When a user is deleted from LDAP but still exists in the Valkey ACL, the module automatically removes that user from Valkey's ACL on the next authentication attempt. This ensures that ACL entries stay synchronized with LDAP and prevents unauthorized access from stale user accounts.

**Important Security Notes:**

1. **Exempted users are never deleted**: Users matching the `ldap.exempted_users_regex` pattern are protected from automatic deletion, even if LDAP authentication fails.

2. **Deletion only on "user not found"**: A user is deleted from ACL **only** when LDAP confirms the user does not exist. Wrong passwords or other transient failures will NOT trigger deletion, preventing denial-of-service attacks from password typos.

3. **Deletion triggers**: A user is deleted from ACL when:
   - The user attempts to authenticate
   - LDAP returns a "user not found" error (not just invalid credentials)
   - The user is not exempted from LDAP authentication

4. **Protected users**: The `default` user and other system users that cannot be deleted by `ACL DELUSER` are automatically protected by Valkey's built-in safeguards.

## Exempting Users from LDAP Authentication

In some scenarios, certain users need to bypass LDAP authentication and use local Valkey authentication instead. Common examples include:

- **Default super admin user**: Administrative access that shouldn't depend on LDAP availability
- **Inter-node communication**: Replication and cluster communication users
- **Monitoring and metrics**: Exporters and health check services that poll frequently
- **Service accounts**: Automated tools and scripts that need reliable authentication

### Why Exempt Users?

Exempting high-frequency service accounts (like Redis exporters) from LDAP reduces load on the LDAP server and prevents potential crashes from excessive authentication requests. It also ensures critical services remain operational even if LDAP becomes unavailable.

### Configuration

Use the `ldap.exempted_users_regex` configuration to specify a regex pattern matching usernames that should bypass LDAP:

```bash
# Exempt specific users
CONFIG SET ldap.exempted_users_regex "^(default|exporter|replication)$"

# Exempt users with a prefix pattern
CONFIG SET ldap.exempted_users_regex "^(admin|metrics-.*|repl-.*)$"

# Clear exemptions (all users go through LDAP)
CONFIG SET ldap.exempted_users_regex ""
```

**Important Notes:**

1. **Local passwords required**: Exempted users must have local passwords configured in Valkey using `ACL SETUSER <username> >password` since they won't authenticate via LDAP.

2. **Exemption takes precedence**: If a username matches the exemption pattern, LDAP is **never contacted** for that user, even if a user with the same name exists in LDAP. Only the local Valkey password will work.

3. **Name conflicts**: To avoid confusion, use distinctive naming conventions for exempted users (e.g., `local-exporter`, `valkey-admin`) or ensure exempted usernames don't exist in your LDAP directory.

4. **Protection from automatic deletion**: Exempted users are protected from the automatic ACL cleanup feature. When a non-exempted user fails LDAP authentication, they are automatically removed from Valkey's ACL. Exempted users will never be automatically deleted, even if authentication fails.

### Example Setup

```bash
# Create local users with passwords
ACL SETUSER default on >supersecret +@all ~*
ACL SETUSER exporter on >exporterpass +@read ~*
ACL SETUSER replication on >replpass +@all ~*

# Configure LDAP exemptions
CONFIG SET ldap.exempted_users_regex "^(default|exporter|replication)$"

# Regular LDAP users (no local password)
ACL SETUSER bob on resetpass +@hash
ACL SETUSER alice on resetpass +@read

# Authenticate as exempted user (uses local password)
AUTH default supersecret

# Authenticate as LDAP user (uses LDAP password)
AUTH bob ldap-password
```

### Quick Setup: Dynamic ACL Rule Sync

Minimal steps to enable LDAP-backed authorization without manual ACL management:

```bash
# Configure where to search for users and groups (examples)
CONFIG SET ldap.search_base "ou=users,dc=example,dc=com"
CONFIG SET ldap.groups_search_base "ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"

# Set group filter and attributes (defaults shown)
CONFIG SET ldap.groups_filter "objectClass=groupOfNames"
CONFIG SET ldap.groups_member_attribute "member"
CONFIG SET ldap.groups_rules_attribute "valkeyACL"

# Ensure default rules include disabling local passwords
CONFIG SET ldap.default_acl_rules "on resetpass"

# Create the Valkey user (no local password)
ACL SETUSER bob on resetpass

# Authenticate: module binds to LDAP, reads group tokens,
# applies ACL rules dynamically, and authenticates the client
AUTH bob <ldap-password>
```

## Installation

We currently build RPMs for several distributions in the [valkey-ldap Copr project](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/rjd15372/valkey-ldap/).

## Development

### Build Instructions

ValkeyLDAP uses Cargo for building the Valkey module.

```bash
cargo build
```

### Manual Module Testing

The project has a collection of scripts to start an LDAP and Valkey server using docker-compose to easily test the module.

To start a Valkey CLI shell to test the module commands, run:

```bash
./scripts/run_test_cli.sh
```

The above command will start the LDAP and Valkey servers, and opens the valkey CLI shell. When the shell closes, it also stops the LDAP and Valkey servers.

If you just want to start the LDAP and Valkey server, run:

```bash
./scripts/start_valkey_ldap.sh
```

You can connect to the LDAP server and Valkey server from the localhost address.

To stop the servers, run:

```bash
./scripts/stop_valkey_ldap.sh
```

### Automated Integration Tests

The integration tests are written in python 3, and live in the `test/integration` directory. To run the tests locally we suggest to create a virtual environment to install the necessary python dependencies.

Assuming you have python 3 installed in your system, to install the python dependencies using a virtual environment do the following:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r test/integration/requirements.txt
```

After setting up the virtual environment, you can run the test using the following command:

```bash
./script/run_integration_tests.sh
```
